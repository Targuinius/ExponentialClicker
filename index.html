        Start out with clicking the big bad "Increment" button (I know, he's not all that big or bad, he's actually quite a nice guy!). This will start giving you 0.1 score per second.<br />
        Keep on clicking and once you have enough, buy the first upgrade and click once again. What's that? So many more points? That's right! The first column will give your more of the so called "power" per click.<br />
        The more power you have, the more points you gain per second.<br />
        Then, once you have enough points you can buy things from the second column. The first building here will give you 10 power<br />
        Now, this doesn't seem like too much, but once you get the second building, you all of a sudden gain one of the first building per second! This will go on and on until the sixth building.<br />
        Now, the third and fourth row work a little different. These will add a multiplier to the upgrade above them. So for every upgrade you buy, you get +1 multiplier.<br />
        That's about it, if you are annoyed with me, feel free to click the "Tutorial" button to get me out of your life.
