# ExponentialClicker

This is like my first game ever.
This is also like my first GitHub thing ever.
How does this site work?
I hope this works at least.

Anyway, I first started this game to get better with JS (And because I was incredibly bored at school). You basically just click and get more and more score per second. The clicking is not really exponential, but the buildings are. I hope you enjoy it!
